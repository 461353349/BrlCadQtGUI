This package contains the MS Windows brlcad.dll libraries with the
corresponding *.lib files (win32 and x64, optimized, multithread and linked
with static version of the C runtime library). It can be used to build
applications using BRL-CAD as library. For further information have a look at
the example.

The header files in include/brlcad are intended to be used with the new object
oriented C++ interface. For further information have a look at the example and
the BRL-CAD wiki: http://brlcad.org/wiki/BRL-CAD's_core_C++_interface

The BRL-CAD runtime libraries are covered by the terms of the LGPL version 2.1
as published by the Free Software Foundation. See COPYING for more information.

This product includes software developed by the University of California,
Berkeley and its contributors.
